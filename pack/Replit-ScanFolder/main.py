'''
write a function ScanFolder that, given the path to a folder, recursively finds all the files and folders stored in the folder and its subfolders at any level, and returns their paths as a list of strings, sorted alphabetically.
for example, given the following folder structure:
a -
  | - t1.txt
  |
  | - b
  |   | - t1.txt
  |   | - t2.txt
  |
  | - c
  |
  | - d
      | - t2.txt

the function ScanFolder("a") returns the list:
["a", "a/b", "a/b/t1.txt", "a/b/t2.txt", "a/c", "a/d", "a/d/t2.txt", "a/t1.txt"]

  for item in obj:
